It is the first game created by\nDvoika Games, which was formed by former members of the Outfall team — T. Aivel,\nL. Nikulin and D. Grimm. The team brings depth of gameplay and worldbuilding in\nrole-playing games to a new level of realism. A new aspect of the game was a world\nwhere, unlike the usual fantasy vs. science dichotomy, a fantasy steampunk is\nproposed, where an industrial revolution is taking place. The dichotomy of magic\nand technology was designated as the basis of the whole game's plot.\n\nThere is a place where magic and technology rule side by side, and any adventurer\ncan as easily master a flintlock pistol as a blazing sword. Ginecarum is a\ncontinent where humans, dwarves, elves and orcs live in various places. The\ninvention of the steam engine led to a wave of inventiveness and to the growing\nrole of technology and science on the continent, causing those of older customs\nto become unhappy. Now on the vast continent, where in growing industrial cities...",

The Telegi clan dwarves are the\nonly people who call this place their home. The mountains are the higher of the\ntwo, and there are no passes, however along the bank of the far-eastern river\nthere is a passage that can be used to travel from north to south using the local\nmap.\n\nFormerly this place was known as the Bormian Forest until the Krabant lumbermen\nfelled it. The Bormian Plains, occupying much of the land south of the Grey\nMountains, surrounded by the cities of the United Kingdom Krabant and Charberi,\nare now an extensive shrubland.\n\nThe Shimmering Forest is the largest and oldest forest in Ginecarum, located in\nthe northwest of the continent.
