      Ginecarum is one of the pillars of classic RPGs, standing alongside games such as
      Outfall, Fafnir's Gate and Starscape: Torture. It is the first game created by
      Dvoika Games, which was formed by former members of the Outfall team — T. Aivel,
      L. Nikulin and D. Grimm. The team brings depth of gameplay and worldbuilding in
      role-playing games to a new level of realism. A new aspect of the game was a world
      where, unlike the usual fantasy vs. science dichotomy, a fantasy steampunk is
      proposed, where an industrial revolution is taking place. The dichotomy of magic
      and technology was designated as the basis of the whole game's plot.

      There is a place where magic and technology rule side by side, and any adventurer
      can as easily master a flintlock pistol as a blazing sword. Ginecarum is a
      continent where humans, dwarves, elves and orcs live in various places. The
      invention of the steam engine led to a wave of inventiveness and to the growing
      role of technology and science on the continent, causing those of older customs
      to become unhappy. Now on the vast continent, where in growing industrial cities...

      In Ginecarum players can explore vast areas of diverse terrain, consisting of the
      continental part of the landmass and several islands. Travel around the world is
      usually carried out by railroad or by boat, although both magic (teleportation)
      and more mundane means (on foot) are often used.

      These mountains stretch from the southwestern tip of Ginecarum to the Shimmering
      Forest in the northwest, making them the longest of the two mountain ranges in
      Ginecarum. The Stonewall Range also serves as the home for most of Ginecarum's
      dwarf clans and is the starting point for the game.

      This range begins in the west where the Stonewall Range ends, and stretches east
      to the river separating the Mendygrout Wastes. The Telegi clan dwarves are the
      only people who call this place their home. The mountains are the higher of the
      two, and there are no passes, however along the bank of the far-eastern river
      there is a passage that can be used to travel from north to south using the local
      map.

      Formerly this place was known as the Bormian Forest until the Krabant lumbermen
      felled it. The Bormian Plains, occupying much of the land south of the Grey
      Mountains, surrounded by the cities of the United Kingdom Krabant and Charberi,
      are now an extensive shrubland.

      The Shimmering Forest is the largest and oldest forest in Ginecarum, located in
      the northwest of the continent. The forest is home to much of Ginecarum's elven
      population. Within are the tree cities Kintarra and N'set-Ang.

    Ginecarum is a computer role-playing game by the studio Dvoika Games whose action
    takes place on the fantastical continent called **Ginecarum**. In the game's world
    magic and technology are combined, creating a unique fantasy-steampunk style. The
    game is the first release from Dvoika Games and is inspired by classic RPGs such
    as *Outfall*, *Fafnir's Gate* and *Starscape: Torture*.

    The continent of Ginecarum is inhabited by humans, dwarves, elves and orcs, and its
    landscape includes mountains, plains, forests, swamps and islands. An industrial
    revolution and the rise of technology created a dichotomy between magic and
    science that forms the core of the plot. Players explore vast territories traveling
    by railroad, boat, magical means, or on foot.

      [3] ...the Stonewall Range, which lies on the border of Nambria and the United
      Kingdom. It is surprisingly cosmopolitan due to its size in both population and
      services. The city is nominally governed by a constable who also acts as mayor,
      although unilateral actions and vigilante justice are common. Both magic and
      technology are practiced freely, though neither is particularly sophisticated.

      Quiet Waters is a reduced version of Rainy Hills. It is more isolated from other
      human settlements but, due to its location near both mountain ranges, has more
      contact with dwarves and elves. It is notable for, among other things, housing
      the temple of Gesthianna and a foundry where both magical and technological
      weapons are forged. Its isolation also attracts adventurers and big-game hunters
      seeking to explore the wilds.

      Zhulla — the city of mages, home to all who practice magic or wish to learn it.
      Rumor has it that it is located in the Mendygrout Wastes, but its exact location
      is kept top secret. It is led by the chief master Simeon Tor and his assistant
      Jorian. People of all races are invited, provided they are not inclined toward
      technology. Zhulla is apolitical and occasionally offers aid to various
      kingdoms.

      The Void is a land outside ordinary time and space, on a separate plane of

      [4] N''set-Ang

      N''set-Ang (orig. N''set-Ang) — the city of dark elves.

      The primary homeland of the dark elves. Like Kintarra, N''set-Ang is supported
      by tree trunks, old and twisted. It is a dark place in every sense and is guarded
      by strong magic, which prevents the hero from using magic inside N''set-Ang. The
      city is inhabited exclusively by dark elves who do not want to see other races on
      their grounds, including the elves of Kintarra.

      Kedobaan are intelligent reptiles. They do not distinguish between warm-blooded
      creatures. They tend to treat them with distrust and hostility because they are
      prey for poachers. They are also tied to an ending of the game if you complete the
      quest to kill/not kill the poachers.

      They apparently worship Kamaal, whose altar can be found in the settlement.

      Characteristics can be judged by the companion that can be recruited in the

      Rainy Hills is a small mining town. It has its own small temple (church), which
      houses a steam engine; the Ristecce shop (a quest giver and key character), the
      doctor Doc Bobbins (a quest giver and key character), the herbalist Gailin, and
      you can also meet a magical vendor and others. The town has several houses, an
      inn and a bank.

      We can reach it at the very start of the game. We are given a task to find
      something about a ring and to find Joachim's note located in the tavern. Hrindjil
      gives hints toward the note. But this is optional; you can go straight to
      Ristecce, ask him about the ring, complete his request: find some interesting
      object — there are two in total...

      Doc Bobbins is the local physician in Rainy Hills. He can heal the main character
      for a fee. If asked about work, he can offer a quest to prevent a bank robbery.

      Bobbins will join as a temporary companion provided:
      • The player has not robbed the bank themselves
      • The player accepted Doc Bobbins' quest
      • When all robbers are killed, Bobbins will leave and give a reward when spoken to again

      • Bobbins will leave the party if the player takes too long to enter the bank
      • He will also leave if the player attempts to take a gun or ammunition from his inventory

      • Bobbins will appear at the gate leading out of town and confront the player if the
        player's own bank robbery fails
      • If Dukan the Witless is also still at the gate, Bobbins will kill him and his companions

      [1] Airship "Chocolate"

      The airship "Chocolate" (orig. IFS Chocolate) — a vehicle that crashes with the
      protagonist aboard in Ginecarum: Of Electricworks and Wizard's Obscura.

      "Chocolate" was an airship that became the first lighter-than-air flying machine
      in Ginecarum.

      On January 1, 1885, "Chocolate" made its maiden voyage, transporting passengers
      from Baladon to Krabant, but the journey ended tragically when it was shot down by
      bandit cannibals flying an experimental heavier-than-air armed plane. The airship
      crashed near the small mining town of Rainy Hills, leaving only one survivor.

      Marvin Beaverbrook — one of the passengers of the airship "Chocolate". He may
      survive the crash and become the protagonist. He was heading to Krabant to enroll
      in the Vestrela Military Academy at his parents' behest.

      Marvin Beaverbrook was born in a small halfling town, showed promise in various
      technological disciplines, but was also prone to petty theft. Although generally
      not a bad child, his closet was always full of ill-gotten goods taken from friends
      and neighbors, along with various golden relics from a temple in a nearby human
      village.

      His parents decided to take serious measures when young Marvin became interested
      in explosives and the contents of the treasury.

      Marvin was put on the airship Chocolate and sent to Krabant, where by parental
      petition he had already been enrolled for the spring term at the Vestrela Military
      Academy as a promising youth. Needless to say, Marvin is not thrilled by the
      prospect.

      Nugard Bloostone is the son of a miner. Over his doorway hangs a plaque: "Any job
      not done with one's own hands is worth nothing." Unfortunately, as a child Nugard
      engaged in what his father called "mindless thinking", so the young Nugard's gift
      on his father's birthday — a steam shovel — ended up at the bottom of the well.
      Nevertheless, despite his father's opinion, Nugard studied hard and awaited the
      day he could work with the greatest inventors and scientists of Krabant.

      Upon reaching dwarf adulthood, Nugard was allowed to enroll in Krabant University,
      which he immediately took advantage of by buying a ticket on the airship Chocolate
      and heading to the most industrial city in all of Ginecarum.
