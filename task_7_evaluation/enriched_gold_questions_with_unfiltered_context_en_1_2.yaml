      Ginecarum is one of the pillars of classic RPGs, standing alongside games such as
      Outfall, Fafnir's Gate and Starscape: Torture. It is the first game created by
      Dvoika Games, which was formed by former members of the Outfall team — T. Aivel,
      L. Nikulin and D. Grimm. The team brings depth of gameplay and worldbuilding in
      role-playing games to a new level of realism. A new aspect of the game was a world
      where, unlike the usual fantasy vs. science dichotomy, a fantasy steampunk is
      proposed, where an industrial revolution is taking place. The dichotomy of magic
      and technology was designated as the basis of the whole game's plot.

      There is a place where magic and technology rule side by side, and any adventurer
      can as easily master a flintlock pistol as a blazing sword. Ginecarum is a
      continent where humans, dwarves, elves and orcs live in various places. The
      invention of the steam engine led to a wave of inventiveness and to the growing
      role of technology and science on the continent, causing those of older customs
      to become unhappy. Now on the vast continent, where in growing industrial cities...

      In Ginecarum players can explore vast areas of diverse terrain, consisting of the
      continental part of the landmass and several islands. Travel around the world is
      usually carried out by railroad or by boat, although both magic (teleportation)
      and more mundane means (on foot) are often used.

      These mountains stretch from the southwestern tip of Ginecarum to the Shimmering
      Forest in the northwest, making them the longest of the two mountain ranges in
      Ginecarum. The Stonewall Range also serves as the home for most of Ginecarum's
      dwarf clans and is the starting point for the game.

      This range begins in the west where the Stonewall Range ends, and stretches east
      to the river separating the Mendygrout Wastes. The Telegi clan dwarves are the
      only people who call this place their home. The mountains are the higher of the
      two, and there are no passes, however along the bank of the far-eastern river
      there is a passage that can be used to travel from north to south using the local
      map.

      Formerly this place was known as the Bormian Forest until the Krabant lumbermen
      felled it. The Bormian Plains, occupying much of the land south of the Grey
      Mountains, surrounded by the cities of the United Kingdom Krabant and Charberi,
      are now an extensive shrubland.

      The Shimmering Forest is the largest and oldest forest in Ginecarum, located in
      the northwest of the continent. The forest is home to much of Ginecarum's elven
      population. Within are the tree cities Kintarra and N'set-Ang.

      [4] Dukan the Witless

      Dukan the Witless — a character in the game Ginecarum.

      Dukan the Witless is an amateur thief, brigand, intellectual and criminal seeking
      recognition in the thieve's underworld. He and his friends — two half-ogres —
      operate near the Rainy Hills area and recently took control of a bridge. Dukan the
      Witless is distinguished by his unique malapropisms and his tendency to be easily
      persuaded.
  answer: |-
    Ginecarum is a computer role-playing game by the studio Dvoika Games whose action
    takes place on the fantastical continent called **Ginecarum**. In the game's world
    magic and technology are combined, creating a unique fantasy-steampunk style. The
    game is the first release from Dvoika Games and is inspired by classic RPGs such
    as *Outfall*, *Fafnir's Gate* and *Starscape: Torture*.

    The continent of Ginecarum is inhabited by humans, dwarves, elves and orcs, and its
    landscape includes mountains, plains, forests, swamps and islands. An industrial
    revolution and the rise of technology created a dichotomy between magic and
    science that forms the core of the plot. Players explore vast territories traveling
    by railroad, boat, magical means, or on foot.
- question: "Which city is hidden from outsiders' sight?"
  expected_answer: "The elven city Kintarra (Quintarra) is hidden from outsiders' eyes."

      [2] Rainy Hills

      [3] ...the Stonewall Range, which lies on the border of Nambria and the United
      Kingdom. It is surprisingly cosmopolitan due to its size in both population and
      services. The city is nominally governed by a constable who also acts as mayor,
      although unilateral actions and vigilante justice are common. Both magic and
      technology are practiced freely, though neither is particularly sophisticated.

      Quiet Waters is a reduced version of Rainy Hills. It is more isolated from other
      human settlements but, due to its location near both mountain ranges, has more
      contact with dwarves and elves. It is notable for, among other things, housing
      the temple of Gesthianna and a foundry where both magical and technological
      weapons are forged. Its isolation also attracts adventurers and big-game hunters
      seeking to explore the wilds.

      Zhulla — the city of mages, home to all who practice magic or wish to learn it.
      Rumor has it that it is located in the Mendygrout Wastes, but its exact location
      is kept top secret. It is led by the chief master Simeon Tor and his assistant
      Jorian. People of all races are invited, provided they are not inclined toward
      technology. Zhulla is apolitical and occasionally offers aid to various
      kingdoms.

      The Void is a land outside ordinary time and space, on a separate plane of
      existence. It is the final region in the game, and getting there is a one-way
      journey.

      [4] N''set-Ang

      N''set-Ang (orig. N''set-Ang) — the city of dark elves.

      The primary homeland of the dark elves. Like Kintarra, N''set-Ang is supported
      by tree trunks, old and twisted. It is a dark place in every sense and is guarded
      by strong magic, which prevents the hero from using magic inside N''set-Ang. The
      city is inhabited exclusively by dark elves who do not want to see other races on
      their grounds, including the elves of Kintarra.
  answer: "According to the context, **Kintarra** is the elven city hidden from outsiders' sight."
